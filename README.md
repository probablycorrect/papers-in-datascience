Papers In Data Science
=====================

###Reading Papers
----------------------------------------------

Reading research papers is not the same process as it is to read a newspaper, magazine or a novel. Students are not taught formally how to best read a research paper, these resources would guide you in this direction

###Naming Convention
---------------------------------------------

We would create several directories with relevant names and inside each directory we'll share the papers and abstracts, have a discussion file with the same name inside the same directory
